# 03_08 Solution: Develop a CI/CD Pipeline for a Python Script

In this challenge, you‚Äôll develop a GitHub Actions workflow for a Python script.

The goal is to build a full CI/CD pipeline that includes linting and tests, artifact creation, and artifact testing.

You‚Äôll also configure your workflow to use the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) to store and retrieve the image.

## Overview

You will complete the following steps in this challenge:

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** using the Python `.gitignore` template
2. **Use the repository in the GitHub Web Editor** to add code and workflows
3. **Add the provided files**:

   - [`hello.py`](./hello.py) (Python script)
   - [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) (for building the image)
   - [`.dockerignore`](./.dockerignore) (for building the image)
   - [`python-pipeline.yml`](./python-pipeline.yml) (your CI/CD workflow)

4. **Implement a three-stage pipeline**:

   - Lint and test the Python code
   - Build and push the container image to GHCR
   - Pull and run the image to verify output

5. **Push changes to the repository** and confirm the workflow runs successfully

This challenge should take about 15 minutes to complete.

## Instructions

### Create a New Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and select **New repository**
2. Name the repository (e.g., `python-ci-cd`)
3. Choose **Public** or **Private** visibility
4. Select **Add .gitignore** and choose the **Python** template
5. Select **Create repository**

### Add Files to the Repository in the GitHub Web Editor

1. Press the `.` key in your new repo or navigate to `https://github.dev/your-user-name/you-repo-name`
2. Add the following files to your repo.
   - ***NOTE: Be sure to place the workflow file in the correct location.***
3. Commit all files to your repo and push the changes.

- `hello.py`

```py
print("Hello, world!")
```

- `Dockerfile`

```json
FROM python:3.13-slim

COPY hello.py .

CMD ["python", "hello.py"]
```

- `.dockerignore`

```json
.github
.git
.gitignore
README.md
```

- `python-pipeline.yml`

```json
name: Python CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push, workflow_dispatch]

```

### Review Workflow Results

1. Go to the **Actions** tab to confirm the workflow starts
2. Once completed, verify that all stages completed successfully.
3. From the repository home page, confirm that the image was pushed to GHCR

4. Go to your repository on GitHub and select the **Actions** tab.

   Alternate Text: View the Actions tab

5. Select the most recent run triggered by your push.

   Alternate Text: View the most recent workflow

6. Review the logs for each job.

   Alternate Text: Review the logs for each job \- part 1

   Alternate Text: Review the logs for each job \- part 2

   Alternate Text: Review the logs for each job \- part 3
